      According to the XML spec, an XML processor is supposed to convert all 
      CR-LF pairs (and single CRâ€™s) to a single LF.
      (see http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#sec-line-ends).
      
      2.11 End-of-Line Handling
      XML parsed entities are often stored in computer files which, for editing 
      convenience, are organized into lines. 
      These lines are typically separated by some combination of the characters 
      carriage-return (#xD) and line-feed (#xA).
      To simplify the tasks of applications, the characters passed to an 
      application by the XML processor must be as if 
      the XML processor normalized all line breaks in external parsed entities 
      (including the document entity) on input, 
      before parsing, by translating both the two-character sequence #xD #xA and 
      any #xD that is not followed by #xA to a single #xA character.
  
      NewLineHandling setting applies when writing text content or attribute 
      values. Each of the NewLineHandling values is described below:
        Entitize - The Entitize setting tells the XmlWriter to replace new line 
        characters that would not be otherwise preserved by a normalizing XmlReader 
                   with character entities. This is useful in round-trip 
                   scenarios where the output is read by a normalizing XmlReader. 
                   Additional normalization rules apply for attribute values when 
                   round tripping since \t, \n and \r are replaced with a space 
                   in attribute values 
                   when normalized in an XmlReader.

        Replace - The Replace setting tells the XmlWriter to replace new line 
        characters with \r\n, which is the new line format used by the 
                  Microsoft Windows operating system. This helps to ensure that 
                  the file can be correctly displayed by the Notepad or Microsoft 
                  Word applications. 
                  This setting also replaces new lines in attributes with 
                  character entities to preserve the characters. This is the 
                  default value.

        None    - The None setting tells the XmlWriter to leave the input 
        unchanged. This setting is used when you not want any new-line 
        processing. 
                  This is useful when the output is read by an XmlReader that 
                  does not do any normalization (for example, an XmlTextReader 
                  with default settings.)

Here we will describe only additional configuration attributes, because
common ones are described above:

## **SOAP messages and New Line Handling**

According to the **XML** spec, an **XML** processor is supposed to
convert all **CR-LF** pairs (and single CR's) to a single LF (see
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#sec-line-ends>).

**XML** parsed entities are often stored in computer files which, for
editing convenience, are organized into lines. These lines are typically
separated by some combination of the characters carriage-return
(**\#xD**) and line-feed (**\#xA**). To simplify the tasks of
applications, the characters passed to an application by the **XML**
processor must be as if the **XML** processor normalized all line breaks
in external parsed entities (including the document entity) on input,
before parsing, by translating both the two-character sequence **\#xD**
**\#xA** and any **\#xD** that is not followed by **\#xA** to a single
**\#xA** character.

**NewLineHandling** setting applies when writing text content or
attribute values. Each of the **NewLineHandling** values is described
below:

**Entitize** - The **Entitize** setting tells the **XmlWriter** to
replace new line characters that would not be otherwise preserved by a
normalizing **XmlReader** with character entities. This is useful in
round-trip scenarios where the output is read by a normalizing
**XmlReader**. Additional normalization rules apply for attribute values
when round tripping since **\\t**, **\\n** and **\\r** are replaced with
a space in attribute values when normalized in an **XmlReader**.

**Replace** - The **Replace** setting tells the **XmlWriter** to replace
new line characters with **\\r\\n**, which is the new line format used
by the **Microsoft Windows** operating system. This helps to ensure that
the file can be correctly displayed by the **Notepad** or **Microsoft
Word** applications. This setting also replaces new lines in attributes
with character entities to preserve the characters. This is the default
value.

**None** - The **None** setting tells the **XmlWriter** to leave the
input unchanged. This setting is used when you not want any new-line
processing. This is useful when the output is read by an **XmlReader**
that does not do any normalization (for example, an **XmlTextReader**
with default settings.)

For more details about **NewLineHadnling** see [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlwritersettings.newlinehandling%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)

For this purpose there is an extension named
**SoapNewLineHandlingExtension** which is used to handle new line
processings.

__Example:__

```xml
<soapNewLineHandlingExtension enable="true">
    <!-- Turns on entitizing of the request if any characters comes unentitized like '\r'. -->
    <inputProcessing enable="true">
      <xmlWriter newLineHandling="Entitize"></xmlWriter>
    </inputProcessing>

    <!-- Turns on entitizing of the response if any characters comes unentitized like '\r'. -->
    <outputProcessing enable="true">
      <xmlWriter newLineHandling="Entitize"></xmlWriter>
    </outputProcessing>
</soapNewLineHandlingExtension>
```

Extension consists of 2 part - **inputProcessing** and
**outputProcessing**. Enabling or disabling the entire extension is
controlled by the **enable** attribute (**true/false**) of the
**soapNewLineHandlingExtension** configuration tag. Enabling or
disabling a processing part is controlled by the **enable** attribute
(**true/false**) of the processing part configuration tag respectively
(**inputProcessing** or **outputProcessing**). The **newLineHandling**
attribute of the **xmlWriter** tag of each processing part determines
the way new lines are processed. The **inputProcessing** part is
presponsible for the incoming messages and the **outputProcessing** part
is responsible for the outgouing messages respectively.

## Configuring connections

**HDA** Gateway plugin supports multiple connections to different **OPC
XML HDA** servers. Each connection is configured via a separate
"**HdaGateway**" section in the plugin configuration file
**&lt;InstallDir&gt;\\Plugins\\HdaGateway\\Config\\Smart.OpcXml.HdaPlugin.Configuration.xml**.

__Example:__

```xml
<HdaGateway Url="https://swp-dc-2/OpcXmlHda.asmx" 
              Enabled="true" 
              Alias="SWP-DC-2" 
              PathSeparator="." 
              OriginalPathSeparator="." 
              UseAuthentication="true" 
              PreAuthenticate="true"
              Username="mngr" 
              Password="manager" 
              UseDefaultCredentials="false" 
              ClientCertificateHash="2B88177FD972EDCFF1610A035205E995B71B7B34" 
              ServerCertificateHash="75D0FED71881F2141B5B6CB24801DFA554439B1C"
              CompressionType ="gzip"
              UseChunkedTransfer="false"
              MaxItemsPerHdaReadAtTime="0"
              MaxItemsPerHdaReadProcessed="0"
              MaxItemsPerHdaReadRaw="0"/> 
```

\[**Url**\]

> The Uniform Resource Locator to the **OPC XML HDA Server**.

\[**Enabled**\]

> If is set to "**true**", enales the specified gateway connection.

\[**PathSeparator**\]

> Has the same meaning like in [Common Plugin's Configuration
Attributes](#common-plugins-configuration-attributes-1), but refers to
the specified connection.

\[**OriginalPathSeparator**\]

> Has the same meaning like in [Common Plugin's Configuration

\[**UseAuthentication**\]

> Enables authentication if is set to "**true**".

\[**PreAuthenticate**\]

> If is set to "**true**" enables the pre-authentication.
Pre-authentication sends credentials with the request. Thus eliminates
sending requests twice.

\[**Username**\]

> Username for the authentication (if is enabled).

\[**Password**\]

> Password for the authentication (if is enabled);

\[**UseDefautlCredentials**\]

> If is set to true, service logon credentials will be used.

> *``Remark:`` Valid only for **NTLM** or **Kerberos** authentication
mechanisms. Not valid for others (e.g. **Basic** authentication).*

\[**ClientCertificateHash**\]

> Provide thumbprint of the client certificate to be used. If this gateway
is connecting to **Smart OPC XML Server** using **HTTPS** transport
protocol and server configuration parameter
"**ValidateClientCertificates**" is set to "**true**", then you must
provide client certificate hash. Otherwise leave it empty. This
certificate must be installed in the **Personal** certificate store of
**Local Machine**. When client certificate verification is performed,
this certificate hash must be also described in the server configuration
file, under section "**Configuration**", attribute "**ClientCertificateHash**".

\[**ServerCertificateHash**\]

> Provide accepted server certificate thumbprint. If you want your
gateway to validate server certificate, then you must provide server
certificate thumbprint. If you leave this parameter empty, then
gateway will not validate server ssl certificate.

\[**CompressionType**\]

> Specifies if to or not to use compression mechanisms in the
communication. Possible values are "**none**", "**gzip**" or
"**deflate**". If omitted "**none**" will be considered and
compression will not be used.

\[**UseChunkedTransfer**\]

> Possible values are "**true**", "**false**". If omitted
"**false**" will be considered. If is set to "**true**", chunked
transfer encoding will be enabled.

\[**SupportsContinuationPoint**\]

> Possible values are "**true**", "**false**". If omitted
"**false**" will be considered. If is "**true**"
**MaxElementsReturned** will be passed to the gateway and corresponding
**ContinuationPoint** will be exchanged, but address space permission
will not be applied for this gateway.

\[**MaxItemsPerHdaReadAtTime**\]

> Has the same meaning like in [Common Plugin's Configuration
Attributes](opc-xml-hda-module.md#common-plugins-configuration-attributes), but refers to the specified connection.

\[**MaxItemsPerHdaReadProcessed**\]
